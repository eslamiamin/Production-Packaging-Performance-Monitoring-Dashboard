# Production-Packaging-Performance-Monitoring-Dashboard
Due to data confidentiality policies, all datasets used in the portfolio version of this project have been anonymized and modified. The data structure, logic, KPIs, and modeling approach remain consistent with the original implementation, while sensitive information has been removed or altered.

Led the design and implementation of a performance monitoring dashboard for Production & Packaging operations


Established a structured data foundation by collaborating with ERP and system leadership teams


Redesigned data entry workflows to improve data accuracy and governance


Performed continuous reconciliation between production, warehouse, and sales datasets


Modeled and implemented KPIs including productivity metrics, defect rates, plan achievement, and labor efficiency indicators


Conducted multi-month validation and refinement of performance metrics


Delivered executive-ready dashboards used in senior management meetings


Enabled data-driven performance evaluation and incentive system implementation

🎯 Objective
To standardize performance indicators (KPIs) for the Production and Packaging unit and establish a reliable data foundation for performance evaluation and incentive design.

🧩 Initial Challenge
At the beginning of the project, production data lacked structure and reliability:
Data was partially recorded manually in Excel


Inconsistent data entry practices


No fully integrated ERP-based recording process


Discrepancies between production, warehouse, and sales records


Before building any dashboard, the priority was establishing a solid data foundation.

🏗 Implementation Phases
1️⃣ Data Foundation & Governance
Collaborated with the ERP (Rahkaran) and system leadership team


Conducted multiple sessions to redesign data entry workflows


Defined standardized data entry protocols


Facilitated adoption within Production & Packaging units



2️⃣ Data Validation & Reconciliation
Identified missing, inconsistent, or incorrect entries


Performed continuous reconciliation between:


Production output


Warehouse inventory


Sales data


Ensured analytical reliability through systematic validation



3️⃣ KPI Design & Modeling
Designed and implemented key performance indicators including:
Overall Production Productivity


Partial Productivity (Two Separate Teams)


Healthy Output Rate


Defect Rate


Rework/Recycled Rate


Production Plan Achievement Rate


Labor-based Metrics (Man-Hour / Man-Shift Indicators)


KPIs were monitored over several months, iteratively refined, and validated.

4️⃣ Dashboard Development
Designed an executive-level BI dashboard


Focused on clarity, usability, and decision-readiness


Used directly in senior management meetings


Prepared as the foundation for performance-based incentive implementation
